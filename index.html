<p>1. Intellectual property is worth protecting because it allows people to feel free to create stuff without worrying that their work is going to get copied. In my opinion, there are some ways to stop pirates. First, since the government has access to the internet, the government should delete the websites that offer pirated stuff. For example, ÂµTorrent. Second, do the same thing that Netflix does, when you try to take a screenshot or a record the video/picture is black.

2. In Game of Thrones, when the new episodes were coming out, people were recording the episodes and uploading them so other people can download them. If HBO or other channels that stream the episodes show do the same thing that Netflix is doing because when they take pictures or record the episodes it will show back. If the channels started doing that then the websites that are posting links to download them, they will have fewer things to post.

3. Option A, The channels that stream should use the thing that Netflix use to stop people from recording or taking pictures, this can stop the websites to post less pirated stuff. Opinion B, the government should delete websites that offer pirated stuff. Option C, make the companies of TV to delete the recording thing to stop people recording stuff.

4. Options A and C are the best in my opinion because if the streamers use that thing that makes the picture/video black then the recording feature will be useless because if they are trying to record then the video will be black.Option B might not work because there are many ways to get the websites back up a and also there are a lot of websites and I think the government can take all the websites down.

5. This solution will work because the picture will turn black like in the picture, this can stop piracy but not all of it but it is a step of stopping piracy. This feature should be used in all the channels to stop piracy.
